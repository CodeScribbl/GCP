### Safety filters

The Gemini API provides safety filters that you can adjust across multiple filter categories to restrict or allow certain types of content. You can use these filters to adjust what's appropriate for your use case. See the [Configure safety filters](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/configure-safety-filters) page for details.

When you make a request to Gemini, the content is analyzed and assigned a safety rating. You can inspect the safety ratings of the generated content by printing out the model responses, as in this example:


## Overview

In a challenge lab you’re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

This lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the [Prompt Design in Vertex AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/976) course. Are you ready for the challenge?

## Challenge Scenario

You're a member of an educational content startup specializing in engaging learners with the natural world. You've formed a partnership with Cymbal Direct, an online retailer launching a new line of outdoor gear and apparel designed to encourage young people to explore and connect with nature.

Cymbal Direct wants to create a marketing campaign for its new product line that leverages the power of generative AI. Your task is to help them develop a set of tools within Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform that will streamline the generation of the following:

- **Evocative Product Descriptions**: using image analysis to inspire short, descriptive text that captures the essence of their products and the feeling of being in nature.
- **Catchy Taglines**: focused on highlighting product features, the target audience, and the desired emotional response.
